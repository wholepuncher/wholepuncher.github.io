                    This was a two week project about rapidly prototyping a game with a focus on exploring a single mechanic. The game was developed in Unity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's intended to be a puzzle-platformer. The player controls an avatar capable of picking up, stacking, or throwing objects. The objective 
                    is to use these objects and the environment to reach the end of the map. The initial concept, involving contact pickup and forced dropping on
                    collisions, was a dead-end which meant the game was reworked significantly in the second week, leaving little time for more interesting levels.
