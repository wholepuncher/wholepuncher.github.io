                <p>High School Independent Study: Board Game Design,&nbsp <i>Group of 2</i></p>
                <p>
                    During the final year of high school, I undertook an independent study on board game design with a friend. We mostly followed 
                    the excellent Spring 2014 iteration of MIT's CMS608: Board Game Design (available on
                    <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/cms-608-game-design-spring-2014/">MITOpenCourseware</a>).
                    This was the second project we started, with the goal of designing a board game that focuses on a given player aesthetic experience.  
                    Inspired by our own high school and its competitive atmosphere, we got very involved in it, 
                    so much so that we effectively broke off from the MIT course to focus on developing this game (The never reached Assignment 3 was to 
                    make a "board or card game in which the intended player experience is from a particular
                    person's perspective within a real-world political, economic, or social system", so I argue it works there too). 
                    We weren't able to fully complete it before graduation, and I chose to leave the project. 
                    As such, my website focuses on the state of the game when I still 
                    had a role. My friend actually managed to finish the game and you can see the results on his own website: 
                    <a href="https://www.jorgezhang.com/daggers-highschool/index.html">LINK</a>. Artist Faron drew the box cover art shown on the left.

                    The goal of the game is to achieve "resume points" (victory points) acquired by having good grades, extracurriculars, and other 
                    college application necessities. 
                    The priciple limited resource is "sleep", which can be spent on other resources or directly used for actions.
                    Other resources include "happiness", "stress", "integrity", and academic "stats". Scarcity of resources, or perception thereof, was a key part
                     of the theme.
                    A shuffled deck of impactful events drive the four phases of the game, with each year of school and their respective responsibilities represented.
                    The game supports 2-4 players, and could take over two hours to complete.
